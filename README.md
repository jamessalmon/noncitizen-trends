# noncitizen-trends
Analysis of non-citizen population changes in major U.S. cities, 2018–2023

This project uses R Markdown and visualization tools such as ggplot2 to analyze how the proportion of non-citizens living in the United States’ largest metropolitan areas has changed from 2018 to 2023.

The goal of this project is to evaluate whether public and media narratives about rising “illegal immigration” align with actual demographic trends reflected in Census and ACS data. By examining city-level shifts in non-citizen populations, this analysis seeks to provide a data-driven perspective on immigration patterns and their geographic distribution.

**Methods:**

Data sourced from the American Community Survey (ACS).

Cleaned, joined, and visualized using R, tidyverse, and ggplot2.

Focused on the 100 largest U.S. metro areas, comparing non-citizen shares over time.

**Key Questions:**

Have non-citizen populations actually increased in major U.S. cities since 2018?

Do data trends reflect or contradict the intensity of recent media narratives around immigration?

How do these patterns vary across different regions or city sizes?

**Technologies:**

R, R Markdown

tidyverse, ggplot2, dplyr

ACS data (2018–2023)

US Geological Survey
